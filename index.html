    <h1>Llamas: The Most Majestic Animal On The Planet</h1>
    <p>
      Read on to learn about the <strong>mysteries and wonders</strong> of the <strong>llama</strong>. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Where They Are Found</h2>
    <p>
      Llamas are normally found in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru">Peru</a>. That doesn't mean that llamas aren't in other places. They also are in other regions of <strong>South America</strong>. Llamas are also found on llama farms around the world (where the temperature supports them).

    <h2>Their Food</h2>
    <p>
      Llamas eat <strong>grass, hay, and grain</strong> on a daily basis. This is somewhat the same as a horse. As a treat, they <strong>love apples and carrots</strong> that are cut into pieces. The cost for a llama's food supply would be about $20 to $30 a month, which is quite reasonable. Quick fact: A llama that is being abused or threatened in any shape or form <strong>might spit at it's threat</strong>. Based on this information, we can conclude that llamas are herbivorous.

Basically, there is a <strong>llama pinata</strong> in the game that, personally I think, is adorable.
